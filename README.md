# Keynote to Text

A suite of Applescripts aimed at converting Keynote documents to text formats (Markdown, [Remark](http://gnab.github.io/remark/#1) Markdown, and Taskpaper), and back (Taskpaper only so far...).

The scripts for Markdown have comments and documentation.  The Taskpaper scripts don't, but should be pretty self-explanatory.

I had envisioned writing a Markdown to Keynote script but I think I will just convert md2tp where needed instead.  Taskpaper's Applescript understands the structure of the document which makes for less work than trying to parse the Markdown.

### Broken in the October 2013 release of Keynote

These work with Keynote 5.3 (Keynote '09) but not with Keynote 6.  I plan to keep using Keynote 5.3 for the time being, not least because the Applescript dictionary has been changed in ways that broke these scripts.  Yet another reason to move towards a text-based solution.
