# Keynote to Text

A suite of Applescripts aimed at converting Keynote documents to text formats (Markdown, [Remark](http://gnab.github.io/remark/#1) Markdown, and Taskpaper), and back (Taskpaper only so far...).

The scripts for Markdown have comments and documentation.  The Taskpaper scripts don't, but should be pretty self-explanatory.
